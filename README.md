My first (real) Agda proof !

Proof of progress and preservation for the simply-typed lambda calculus with booleans, using string binders with variable shadowing.

Eventual TOODs:
- Simplify substitution using a function and pattern matching instead of an algebraic data type.
- Use Agda's standard library for reflexive-transitive closure.
- Define and use a context deletion operation.
- Try a similar proof using well-scoped De Bruijn indexes.
- Try a similar proof using an higher-order abstract syntax.
